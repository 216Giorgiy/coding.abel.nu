Code samples for http://coding.abel.nu

Whenever I write blog posts containing code, I do test the code before 
publishing. Some of the code is organized in a library that is meant
to be reusable (CodingAbelNu.Utilities) while some other code is just
samples that are created together with whatever supporting code is needed
to run the sample code.
